## Async vs Sync
Choosing Between Sync and Async
- Use Sync if:
   - You prefer a simpler, more linear code flow.
   - Your tests do not require concurrent operations and the performance impact is minimal.
     
- Use Async if:
   - You need to perform operations concurrently to speed up test execution.
   - You are comfortable with handling Promise chains and async/await patterns.
     
- Comparison Table:
  | Aspect | Synchronous | Asynchronous |
  | ---- | ---- | ---- |
  | Execution Flow | Blocking, Step by Step | Non-Blocking, Concurrent Operations |
  | Code Complexity | Simpler, more linear | More Complex, Requires async/await |
  | Error Handling | Standard Try-Catch Blocks | Requires handling Promises and Async error |
  | Performance | Generally slower, as each step waits for the previous one to complete | Potentially faster due to parallel execution |
  | Use Case | Preferred for simpler scripts and linear tasks | Ideal for complex tasks that benefit from concurrency |
  | Readability | Easier to read and write | Requires understanding of asynchronous programming |
  | Learning Curve | Lower, suitable for beginners | Higher, requires familiarity with async patterns |
  | Examples | from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright | from playwright.async_api import async_playwright |
  | Function Example | def run_sync() | async def run_async() |
  | Execution Example | run_sync() | asyncio.run(run_async()) |

## Initial Install
1. (Optional) Create Virtual Environment
   - Using Visual Studio Code, you can run this command in the terminal:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   - You can then run this command to start the virtual environment:
   ```
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   - If running into unable to activate environment, run this:
   ```
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
   ```
   
2. Install Playwright
   ```
   pip install playwright
   ```
   
3. Install Playwright Drivers
   ```
   playwright install
   ```

## Setting up Basic Synchronous Project
- Libraries to Import:
  ``` python
  from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
  ```

- Main Code:
  ``` python
  with sync_playwright() as playwright:
  
    # Launch Browser
    browser = playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)
  
    # Create a new page/tab
    page = browser.new_page()
  
    # Visit playwright website
    page.goto("https://playwright.dev/python/")
  
    # Close browser
    browser.close()
  ```

## Using REPL
- REPL is basically an interactive tester. With this, you will be able to locate and highlight elements realtime.
- Getting Started
  1. Open Terminal and Navigate to Project Directory
  2. Activate the Virtual Environment
  3. Run command to start python
     ```
     python
     ```
     or
     ```
     ptpython
     ```
  4. Start Coding:
     ```
     from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
     playwright = sync_playwright().start()
     browser = playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False, slow_mo=700)
     page = browser.new_page()
     page.goto("https://playwright.dev/python/")
     ```

## Using Inspector
- Inspector is an interactive tester that allows you to highlight over certain elements and shows you the exact way to locate.
- It will also record each action you do. 
- Great way to do Exploratory testing.
- Starting Inspector:
  ```
  playwright codegen website.com
  ```

## Tracing
- Tracing allows you to capture and analyze execution of your test.
   - Captures Execution Details - Records detailed information about actions taken
   - Visualizes Test Runs - Creates a timeline of test execution. Includes screenshots, DOM snapshots, network requests, and console logs.
   - Identifies Issues - Where and why tests might be failing
   - Performance Analysis - Provides insights on how long different actions take
- Example:
  ``` python
  # Launch Browser
  browser = playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False, slow_mo=700)

  # Playwright Tracing
  context = browser.new_context()
  context.tracing.start(screenshots=True, snapshots=True, sources=True)

  # Create a new page/tab
  page = context.new_page()

  # Visit playwright website
  page.goto("https://playwright.dev/python/")

  # Locate link element with "Docs" text
  docs_button = page.get_by_role('link', name="Docs")
  docs_button.click()

  # Get URL
  print("Docs: ", page.url)

  # Closes Tracing
  context.tracing.stop(path = "trace.zip")

  # Close browser
  browser.close()
  ```

- Open the trace.zip by running terminal command:
  ```
  playwright show-trace trace.zip
  ```

## Locators
- ``` python
  # Locates by explicity or implicit accessibility attributes.
  page.get_by_role() 
  ```
- ``` python
  # Locates by text content
  page.get_by_text() 
  ```
- ``` python
  # Locates a form control by label's text
  page.get_by_label() 
  ```
- ``` python
  # Locates input by placeholder
  page.get_by_placeholder() 
  ```
- ``` python
  # Locates image by alternative text
  page.get_by_alt_text() 
  ```
- ``` python
  # Locates by title attribute
  page.get_by_title() 
  ```
- ``` python
  # Locates by data-testis attribute
  page.get_by_test_id() 
  ```
- ``` python
  # Locates using CSS Selector or XPath
  page.locator() 
  ```
   - ``` python
     # Locates by position of list of webelements
     .locator("nth=#") 
     ```
   - ``` python
     # Locates by keyword
     .locator("id=something") 
     ```
   - ``` python
     # Locates by visible element
     .locator("visible=true") 
     ```
   - ``` python
     # Locates Parent path
     .locator("..") 
     ```
   - ``` python
     # Filters for specific element
     .filter(has_text="Something") 
     ```
   - ``` python
     # Filters by an element inside of an element
     .filter(has=page.get_by_label("Something")) 
     ```
 
## Mouse Actions
- ``` python
  # Default left click
  .click() 
  ```
   - ``` python
     # Right click
     .click(button="right") 
     ```
   - ``` python
     # Allows for different inputs with clicking
     .click(modifiers=["Shift", "Alt", "Control", "Meta"]) 
     ```
- ``` python
  # Double left click
  .dblclick() 
  ```
- ``` python
  # Moves mouse cursor over an element
  .hover() 
  ```

## Input Field Actions
- ``` python
  # Enters input as if CTRL + C and CTRL + V
  .fill() 
  ```
- ``` python
  # Enters input as if actually typing
  .type() 
  ```
   - ``` python
     # Can also add a delay to adjust speed of typing
     .type("Something", delay=200) 
     ```
- ``` python
  # Gets current value of input box (NOT placeholder value)
  .input_value() 
  ```
- ``` python
   # Clears current input value
   .clear() 
  ```

## Checkbox and Radio Inputs
- ``` python
  # Sets checkbox or radio input to true or selected
  .check() 
  ```
- ``` python
  # Sets checkbox or radio input to false or unselected
  .uncheck() 
  ```
- ``` python
  # Sets to true or false
  .set_checked() 
  ```
- ``` python
  # Clicks on checkbox or radio input
  .click() 
  ```
- ``` python
  # Checks the current status of checkbox or radio button
  .is_checked() 
  ```

## Option and Select Menu
- ``` python
  # Selects a specific option based on index position
  .select_option() 
  ```
   - ``` python
     # Allows you select multiple options
     .select_option(["2","4"]) 
     ```
 
## Uploading File 
- ``` python
  file_input = page.get_by_label("Default file input example")

   with page.expect_file_chooser() as fc_info:
       file_input.click()
   
   file_chooser = fc_info.value
   file_chooser.set_files("app.py")
  ```
